# python-challenge

I have worked on two data sets.

First is PyBank and second is PyPoll.

In both of them I used different command's to print data in a text file.

In the first data set PyBank I used Python to find the following results.

            The total number of months included in the dataset

            The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

            The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes

            The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

            The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

Then I used command to print the result's on terminal.

Then I used the write command to export all the results into a text file.

In this data set I used command to print all line differnetly.

In the first data set PyBank I used Python to find the following results.

         The total number of votes cast

         A complete list of candidates who received votes

         The percentage of votes each candidate won

         The total number of votes each candidate won

         The winner of the election based on popular vote  


Then I used command to print the result's on terminal.

Then I used the write command to export all the results into a text file.

In this data set I used all collected all the data into output_txt and then used (writelines) function to print the data into the text file.
